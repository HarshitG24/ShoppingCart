5. Cart items in minimongo
6. Pagination added, there are like 2 products on each page and there is a static data of total 20 products, so total 10 pages. Users can use next and previous button to navigate through pages and then can also see the current page they are in. ( Everytime user changes the page, data is updated on the frontend)

# Minimongo
1. All the products are added to the minimongo database.
2. The items added to cart or removed from cart are also added to minimongo database.

If we add a product or delete a product and if the page is refreshed, the cart items remains as it is, since the data is retrieved from minimongo database.
